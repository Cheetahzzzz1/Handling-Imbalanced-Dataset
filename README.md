# Handling-Imbalanced-Dataset

# Overview

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates techniques for managing and analyzing imbalanced datasets using Python libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas. The notebook walks through the process of generating an imbalanced dataset, exploring its properties and applying resampling methods to balance the classes.

The methods include:-

1. Dataset creation with class imbalance.

2. Exploration of class distribution

3. Application of oversampling techniques
