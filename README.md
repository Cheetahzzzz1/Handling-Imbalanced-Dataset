# Handling-Imbalanced-Dataset

# Overview

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates techniques for managing and analyzing imbalanced datasets using Python libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas. The notebook walks through the process of generating an imbalanced dataset, exploring its properties and applying resampling methods to balance the classes.

The methods include:-

1. Dataset creation with class imbalance.

2. Exploration of class distribution

3. Application of oversampling techniques 

# Features

<ins> Dataset Creation </ins>

1. Generate synthetic data with imbalanced classes using "make_classification" from "scikit-learn".

2. Explore and visualize class distributions.

<ins> Class Balancing </ins>

Implement oversampling techniques using "RandomOverSampler".

<ins> Analysis </ins>

Examine the impact of resampling on the class distribution.

# Prerequisites

1. pandas

2. numpy

3. scikit-learn

# Outputs

1. Initial Dataset Distribution : Displays the proportion of samples in each class.

2. Resampled Dataset : Shows the new distribution after applying oversampling techniques.
